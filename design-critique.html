        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>This page contains two team write-ups: one highlighting a website with poor design choices, and one praising a well-designed site. Each entry relates observations to four core visual-design principles (Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, Proximity).</p>

        <h2>Bad website example</h2>
        <p><strong>Site:</strong> <a href="https://vitalsecurityacademy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vitalsecurityacademy.com</a></p>
        <h3>Why so?</h3>
        <p>There are various inconsistencies found throughout the website that can potentially hurt user experience and navigation, and potentially lead to a loss of sales. Here are various jot notes for problems found on the website:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Inconsistency of total space: there is white space on the left and right of the blue border at the top, while lower on the page the blue container stretches edge-to-edge.</li>
          <li>Responsive video behavior: the hero video gradually decreases in size and then disappears; a better pattern is to keep a consistent size until a breakpoint, then replace or hide it cleanly.</li>
          <li>Multiple videos under “We've Helped Thousands Get Their Security Guard License” are identical and can all play simultaneously, causing audio/visual distortion.</li>
          <li>Accordion issues: clicking the + does not expand content; instead the content becomes a one-line entry inside the box and the + is pushed to the side.</li>
          <li>Language selection inconsistencies: changing language at the top highlights the chosen language in blue, but the same highlight is not shown in the “Frequently Asked Questions” area even though the text changes.</li>
          <li>There is empty whitespace between the end of the “Frequently Asked Questions” container and the footer.</li>
          <li>Clicking “Get Exam Ready in 40 Hours” leads to a login page with no header indication of what the user is signing into.</li>
          <li>Language settings appear available for drop-downs but not consistently applied or offered site-wide.</li>
          <li>The logo does not show a hover affordance indicating it is clickable, although it does link back to the homepage when clicked.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Good website example</h2>
        <p><strong>Site:</strong> <a href="https://www.apple.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">apple.com</a></p>
        <h3>Why so?</h3>
        <p>Let's start by going through two main reasons why this website would prove to be a great candidate for a role model in designing a website.</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> The homepage is divided into clear sections that present Apple’s products. Both desktop and mobile use large, consistent containers that guide users into product areas. The restrained color palette (mostly white) and strong product imagery draw attention to items in a consistent way; CTAs use clear, high-contrast colors to improve visibility.</li>
          <li><strong>Ease of Navigation:</strong> Navigation is simple and predictable. The desktop site uses hover menus with model-level links, while the mobile site uses a collapsible navigation that reveals product groups first and then specific models, preserving large tappable areas and readability.</li>
        </ol>
      </section>

        <h2>Team notes</h2>
        <p>We used four core visual principles — Consistency, Repetition, Alignment, and Proximity — to evaluate each site. We recommend applying consistent typography, a clear color system, and a predictable component library when designing team pages.</p>
